				<h1>History of Python</h3>
					<p>Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially
						designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly
						developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express
						concepts in fewer lines of code.</p>
					<p>In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python
						started. Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of
						1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the Netherlands. It was
						started firstly as a hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him
						occupied during Christmas. The programming language in which Python is said to have succeeded is
						ABC Programming Language, which had interfacing with the Amoeba Operating System and had the
						feature of exception handling. He had already helped to create ABC earlier in his career and he
						had seen some issues with ABC but liked most of the features. After that what he did was really
						very clever. He had taken the syntax of ABC, and some of its good features. It came with a lot
						of complaints too, so he fixed those issues completely and had created a good scripting language
						that had removed all the flaws.</p>
					<h1>Why is Python</h2>
						<p>Python is easy to learn</p>
						<p>It uses a simplified syntax with an emphasis on natural language, for a much easier learning
							curve for beginners. And, because Python is free to use and is supported by an extremely
							large ecosystem of libraries and packages, it's often the first-choice language for new
							developers.</p>

						<h1>What Python can do</h2>
							<p>Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data
								analysis, and data visualization. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been
								adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of
								everyday tasks, like organizing finances.</p>

							<h1>Visual Studio Code</h1>
							<img src="images/VsCode/Visual_Studio_Code_1.35_icon.svg.png" alt="" width="100"
								height="100" />
							<p>Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by
								Microsoft with the Electron Framework, for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include
								support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code
								refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts,
								preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.</p>

							<h1><b>Github</b></h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/GitHub-Logo.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>GitHub is an online software development platform. It's used for storing, tracking, and
								collaborating on software projects.</p>
							<p>It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow
								developers on open-source projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site where
								developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work.</p>
							<h1><b>Why Github</b></h1>
							<p>This is where hosting services like <a href="https://github.com/"
									target="_blank">GitHub</a>,<a href="https://bitbucket.org/"
									target="_blank">Bitbucket</a>, and <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/"
									target="_blank">GitLab</a> come in. They provide a home for your Git-based projects
								on the internet. If you have no idea what Iâ€™m talking about, think of it as DropBox but
								much, much better. The remote host acts as a distribution channel or clearinghouse for
								your Git-managed project. It allows other people to see your stuff, sync up with you,
								and perhaps even make changes. These hosting providers improve upon traditional Unix Git
								servers with well-designed web-based interfaces.</p>
							<h1><b>Python Print Command</b></h1>
							<p>Print Command</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Print String</li>
								<li>Print Numeric</li>
								<li>Print String + Numeric</li>
								<li>Print String + String</li>
								<li>Print Numeric + Numeric</li>
							</ol>
							<h2>Print String</h2>
							<p>Basic Print String Python will use code *** print ('message') or print ("message") ***
							</p>
							<p>If you want your message to contain a single quote, use a double quote to cover the text.
								And If you want your message to contain a double quote, use a single quote to cover the
								text.</p>

									alt="" /></span><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
							<h2><b>Print Numeric</b></h2>
							<p>Python Numbers there are three types of numeric data types in Python:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>int stores positive and negative integer numbers.</li>
								<li>float stores numeric values with decimal points.</li>
								<li>Complex stores imaginary numeric values. with the letter 'j'</li>
							</ul>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/intro/num.png"
									alt="" /></span><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
							<h2><b>Print String + Numeric</b></h2>
							<p>Print String + Numeric It takes a comma, followed by a String or numeric. ***
								print('numeric',"string") or print ("8,'ABC', 96, 74, 'EFG'") ***</p>
							<p>Example of using Print String + Numeric
								*** str() it's mean The text inside the brackets will be String. ***</p>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/intro/str+num.png"
									alt="" /></span><br><br><br><br><br>
							<h2><b>Print String + String</b></h2>
							<p>Print String + String Use comma or + steps between messages. ***
								print('Hello',"How",'Are',"You") or print('Hello'+"How"+'Are'+"You") ***</p>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/intro/str+str.png"
									alt="" /></span><br><br><br><br><br>
							<h2><b>Print Numeric + Numeric</b></h2>
							<p>Print String + String Use comma steps between messages. *** print(8,9,10,11) ***</p>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/intro/num+num.png"
									alt="" /></span><br><br><br><br><br>
							<h2><b>Input</b></h2>
							<p>The input() function takes input from the user and returns it.</p>
							<p>Example</p>
